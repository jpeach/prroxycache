# prroxycache

This project is eventually intended to be a toolkit for inspecting the
on-disk format for common HTTP proxy caches. I'm starting with [Apache
TrafficServer](https://trafficserver.apache.org), and will probably look
into NGINX once I get that into some reasonable shape.

## FAQ

### Is this good code?

No! This is my first Rust project, so I'm bashing on
keys and unlikely to be doing things in good Rust style.

### Is this complete?

Not in the least.

### Why is the repository spelled wrong?

I typo'd the repository creation and couldn't be bothered to fix it.
